# a simple Deno 2.0 bare bones dev container

To be used with VSCode dev containers.

## Instructions

Clone this repo to your local machine and change the basic settings.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Bokomoko/deno2.0-devcontainer.git <your_folder>
```

After creating the folder, cd into it and open with vscode

```bash
cd <your_folder>

VSCode will ask to reopen the project/folder in the container. Do it and after completion, open a terminal (ctrl-`) and check if Deno is ok

If it didn't work, please check the creation of the dev container
